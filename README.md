# EDA-Analysis-and-visualization-on-Time-series-dataset-on-Electricity-consumption-of-various-states
Hello, I'm Pooja TN, and I'm thrilled to present my Internship project from CodersCave, which revolves around Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), analysis, and visualization of a time series dataset detailing electricity consumption across various states in Tamil Nadu.
## Data Set Overview
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle's public repository, comprises 34 attributes and 504 records. It includes a combination of numeric and datetime values, providing insights into electricity usage over a span of more than three years, from 2019 to 2023. The attributes cover information on states, usage, longitude, latitude, regions, and datetime.
### Project Highlights
In the course of this project, I made use of Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and analysis, along with plotly.express for creating insightful visualizations. Additionally, I leveraged built-in EDA functions to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset.
